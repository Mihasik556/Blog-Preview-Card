## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

There are some parts of my code that I`m really proud of.

For example, I like how I used 'figure' tag for better semantics:

```html
<figure class="image"></figure>
```

and

```html
<figure>
    <img
        class="author-avatar"
        src="assets/images/image-avatar.webp"
        alt="Article`s author avatar with smilinig man on it"
    />
</figure>
```

Also I`m very proud of how I managed to make smooth transitions between different sizes.
For example:

```css
.label {
    transition: max-width 0.35s ease;
    transition: min-height 0.35s ease;
}
```

### Continued development

After this project I will continue practicing on Mobile-First Workflow, adaptive CSS sizing and working with Media Queries.
